<p class="p0"><span class="smcap">Sir</span>: I have the honor to transmit herewith a manuscript entitled
"Comb Honey," by Geo. S. Demuth, apicultural assistant in this
bureau.</p>

<p>In view of the increasing demand for the finest grade of comb honey
and a decrease in the amount of comb honey produced, it seems
timely to present to professional beekeepers an analysis of the best
practice as well as to point out some essentials to the production of
maximum crops of the best grade. I recommend the publication of
this paper as a Farmers' Bulletin.</p>

<h1>COMB HONEY.</h1>



<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION"><b>INTRODUCTION.</b></a></h2>


<p>The present tendency in beekeeping is decidedly toward the production
of extracted honey rather than of comb honey. The recent
activity among beekeepers toward specialization, which necessitates
the establishing of out-apiaries, and the rapidly increasing demand
for extracted honey are among the factors bringing about this condition.
Enormous quantities of honey are now used for manufacturing
purposes, and this demand is, of course, solely for extracted honey.</p>

<p>If the general public finally becomes convinced of the purity and
wholesomeness of extracted honey, this will become a staple article of
food. Comb honey to command the higher price&mdash;proportionate to
the greater cost of production&mdash;must justify the extra cost to the
consumer by its finer appearance. The consumer of extracted honey
is not concerned as to the straightness or finish of the combs in which
it was originally stored, but by virtue of its appearance there will
probably always be a good demand for the finest grade of comb
honey where appearance is the chief consideration. Present tendencies
therefore emphasize the desirability of producing comb honey
of the most attractive appearance possible.</p>

<p>Well-filled sections of comb honey with delicate white comb and perfect
cappings are obtainable only during a rapid honey flow of sufficient
duration to insure their completion. The production of comb honey,
the appearance of which is sufficient to justify its extra cost, requires
a combination of conditions that are peculiar to rather limited areas,
outside of which the beekeeper will find it decidedly advantageous to
produce extracted honey.</p>

<p>Comb-honey production should not be attempted in localities where
the honey flow is very slow or intermittent, where the character of
the honey is such that it granulates quickly in the comb while it is
on the market, where the honey is dark or "off color," or where honeys
from various sources are mixed if these different sources produce
honey of different colors and flavors. Local market conditions may
of course in some instances be such as to make it seem advisable to
produce comb honey in limited quantities in a locality that is not well
suited to comb-honey production, but the beekeeper who produces
comb honey for the general market should first be sure that his is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">« 6 »</a></span>
comb-honey locality. Even in the best localities during an occasional
season conditions are such that it is not possible to produce
comb-honey of fine appearance. Some comb-honey specialists find
it profitable to provide an equipment for extracted honey for such
an emergency. In some cases comb honey is produced only during
the height of the season, when conditions are most favorable, extracting
supers being used both at the beginning and close of the honey
flow.</p>

<p>While the professional beekeeper is thus curtailing the production
of indifferent grades of comb honey, bee diseases are rapidly eliminating
the careless producers. From the present indications, therefore,
it would seem certain that there must be a gradual elimination
from the markets of all inferior and indifferent comb honey&mdash;grades
that must compete directly with extracted honey. This should mark
a new era in the production of the beat grades of comb honey in the
localities that are peculiarly adapted to comb-honey production.
The beekeeper who is thus favorably located will do well to consider
the possibilities of future market conditions for a fancy grade of comb
honey.</p>

<p>Tho following discussion is necessarily but a brief outline of modern
apparatus and methods and of course can not in any sense take the
place of the broad experience necessary in profitable comb-honey
production. It is assumed that the reader is more or less familiar
with the more general phases of beekeeping. (See Farmers' Bulletin
No. 447. This bulletin also contains a complete list of publications
of the Department of Agriculture on beekeeping.)</p>

<p>A building containing storage space for apparatus, a well-lighted and
ventilated workshop as well as a honey room, is a necessity in comb-honey
production. The arrangement and location of the shop and
honey house will depend upon local conditions and circumstances.
Tho usual mistake is in constructing those too small. In the North
the shop and honey house is usually built over the wintering repository
or collar. Since rats or mice would do great damage to the contents
of such a storehouse, the construction should be such as to
exclude them. If a concrete foundation is used and the sills are
embedded in a layer of "green" mortar, no trouble of this kind
should be experienced. If a series of out-apiaries are operated for
comb honey, the supers, extra hives, etc, are usually kept in one
building located near the home of the beekeeper. This serves as a
central station and storehouse, the supplies being hauled to and from
the apiaries as needed. This building may be supplemented by a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">« 7 »</a></span>
very small building at each apiary, though in comb-honey production
this is not really necessary.</p>

<p>The honey room should be so located that it will receive the heat
from the sun, preferably an upstairs room immediately under the
roof. When so located a small hand elevator should be installed for
taking the honey up and down. The room should be papered or
ceiled inside to keep out insects and to permit fumigation if necessary
and should contain facilities for artificially heating in case continued
damp or freezing weather should occur before the honey is marketed.
The honey room should be provided with ample floor support for the
great weight that may be placed upon it.</p>


<h3><a id="Hives"></a><b>Hives.</b></h3>

<p>A beehive must serve the dual purpose of being a home for a colony
of bees and at the same time a tool for the beekeeper. Its main
requirements are along the line of its adaptation to the various manipulations
of the apiary in so far as these do not materially interfere
with the protection and comfort it affords the colony of bees. Since
rapid manipulation is greatly facilitated by simple and uniform
apparatus, one of the fundamental requirements of the equipment in
hives is that they be of the same style and size, with all parts exactly
alike and interchangeable throughout the apiary. While the hives
and equipment should be as simple and inexpensive as possible, consistent
with their various functions, a cheap and poorly constructed
beehive is, all things considered, an expensive piece of apparatus.</p>

<p>In this country the Langstroth (or L) frame (9<sup>1</sup>/<sub>8</sub> by 17<sup>5</sup>/<sub>8</sub> inches)
(<a href="#Fig_1">fig. 1</a>) is the standard frame and throughout this paper frames of
brood will be discussed in terms of this size of frame. The advantages
of standard frames and hives are so great that the beekeeper can not
afford to ignore them for the sake of some slight advantage of another
size.</p>

<p>There is, however, a wide difference of opinion as to the number of
frames that should be used in a single hive body. The wide variation
in the building up of colonies previous to the honey flow in different
localities and seasons, the race of bees, and the skill of the beekeeper
are all factors entering into this problem, which make it improbable
that beekeepers will ever fully agree on this point. The races that
build up more rapidly in the spring are, of course, other things being
equal, able to use to advantage a larger brood chamber than the races
that are more conservative in brood rearing. It is also noticeable
that within certain limits as the beekeeper's skill in building up his
colonies for the flow increases, so the size of the brood chamber
best adapted to his purpose increases. In other words, while the
careful and skillful beekeeper may succeed in having large brood
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">« 8 »</a></span>
chambers well filled with brood at the beginning of the honey flow,
the less skillful beekeeper under similar conditions may be doing well
to approximate this condition with a much smaller brood chamber.</p>

zinc queen excluder. (From Phillips.)</div>
</div>

<p>For comb-honey production the brood chamber should be of such
a size that by proper management it may be well filled with brood
at the beginning of the honey flow, so that the brood and surplus
apartments maybe definitely
separated. A brood chamber
may be considered too large
if by proper management it
is not on an average fairly
well filled with brood at the
beginning of the honey flow,
and too small if it provides an
average of less room than the
colony is able to occupy with
brood previous to the honey
flow. Unless the beekeeper
practices feeding, a brood
chamber that does not contain
sufficient room for both
winter stores and brood rearing
during late summer and
autumn may also be considered
too small. It may be
well to note that by this
standard if the brood chamber
seems to be too large the
fault may lie in the management
during the previous autumn,
winter, or spring. Of
course the brood chamber
that is barely large enough
for one colony will be too
large for another in the same
apiary or the character of the
season may be such that all
brood chambers may be too large for best results one season and too
small the next, so an average must be sought. While by manipulation
good results may be secured by the use of any of the sizes in
common use, any great departure in either direction from the size
best suited to conditions of a given locality necessitates an excessive
increase in labor to give best results. There is at the present time
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">« 9 »</a></span>
a strong tendency toward the use of the 10-frame hive body as a
medium-sized brood chamber which may be used as a unit of a larger
elastic brood chamber when necessary.</p>

</div>

<p>The comb-honey producer is more exacting as to certain details of
construction of hives than is the producer of extracted honey since
it is more necessary for him to handle individual brood frames during
the honey flow. The spaces<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> above and between the top bars of the
brood frames must be accurate or they will be bridged with burr and
brace combs and these filled with honey. Burr and brace combs
make the removal and readjustment of the super and the manipulation
of frames a slow and disagreeable task, to say nothing of the waste
of material, which should have been placed in the sections in the beginning.
The use of the slatted honey board (<a href="#Fig_2">fig. 2</a>), while preventing
brace combs between itself and the
super, does not prevent the building
of burr and brace combs between
and above the top bars of the
frames. This trouble is largely
eliminated by proper spacing. Most
hive manufacturers are at present
making the top bars of the brood
frames of such a width that the
spaces between them is from one-fourth
to five-sixteenths inch with
the same spacing above them. The
difficulty, however, is in maintaining
this spacing with any great
degree of accuracy. Self-spacing
frames<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> are a partial solution of
this difficulty. In some localities,
however, the ordinary self-spacing
frames are so badly propolized as to render their removal from the
brood chamber difficult as well as materially to interfere with the
proper spacing. The advantages of such frames are then nullified,
while their disadvantages are retained or even intensified. In such
localities metal spacers having but small surfaces of contact are sometimes
used. Some beekeepers prefer omitting the spacers entirely.
However, some of the difficulties arising from the use of self-spacing
frames are the result of carelessness on the part of the operator in
not crowding the frames together properly when closing the hive after
having handled the frames.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_1" id="Footnote_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> A bee space, or that space to which bees are least inclined to put comb or propolis, is perhaps a scant
one-fourth inch. In hive construction one-fourth or five-sixteenths inch is usually used.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_2" id="Footnote_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> These are so constructed that the end bars are one-fourth or five-sixteenths inch wider than the top
bars throughout a portion of their length or furnished with projections of metal fitted to the edges of the
frame. In either case the adjustment is such that when the frames are crowded together in the hive the
spaces between the top bars will be correct.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">« 10 »</a></span></p>

<h4><a id="SECTIONAL_HIVES"></a><b>SECTIONAL HIVES.</b></h4>

<p>The sectional hive in which the brood chamber is composed of two
or more shallow hive bodies, making it horizontally divisible, offers
some advantages, especially to the comb-honey specialist. Most of
the ordinary manipulations can be performed readily with such hives
without removing the frames. One of their greatest advantages in
comb-honey production is the rapidity with which the apiarist can
examine the colonies for queen cells if natural swarming is to be
controlled by manipulation. They are also very elastic, the units or
sections usually being of 5-L frame capacity, permitting a brood
chamber capacity of 5 or any multiple of 5-L frames. Among the
disadvantages of these hives are the extra cost owing to the greater
number of parts necessary in their construction and the difficulty
in maintaining proper spacing without the use of top bars on the
frames heavier than would seem advisable in the middle of the
brood nest.</p>


<h3><a id="Sections_and_Supers"></a><b>Sections and Supers.</b></h3>

<p>There is a wide variation in the style of sections and the supers
designed to contain them. This, whole to some extent brought about
by different local conditions, is largely due merely to the notions of
individual beekeepers. Comb-honey apparatus could probably be
standardized without sacrificing any really vital features.</p>

<h4><a id="BEEWAY"></a><b>BEEWAY <i>v.</i> PLAIN SECTIONS.</b></h4>

<p>There are two general styles of sections in common use differing
in the method of spacing&mdash;the beeway section in which the spacer is
a part of the section itself (<a href="#Fig_5">fig. 5</a>), and the plain in which the spacer
is a permanent part of the separator (<a href="#Fig_4">fig. 4</a>). Each style has its
advocates and each offers some advantages.</p>

<div class="fig_caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 3.</span>&mdash;Beeway and plain sections, unfolded. (Original.)</div>
</div>

<p>Some of the advantages of the plain (<a href="#Fig_3">fig. 3</a>) over the beeway sections
are: (1) They are simpler in construction, therefore costing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">« 11 »</a></span>
less. (2) The edges being plain with no insets, the plain sections are
more easily cleaned of propolis when being prepared for market and
are especially adapted
to cleaning by
machinery. (3) By
leaving the spacers
in the super, sections
of the same honey
content occupy less
space in the shipping
case, thus reducing
the cost of
packages. (4) The
plain section is
adapted to an
arrangement permitting freer communication lengthwise of the row of
sections, especially at the corners (<a href="#Page_15">p. 15</a>).</p>

</div>

<p>Some of the advantages of the beeway sections (<a href="#Fig_3">fig. 3</a>) are: (1)
The honey is somewhat
less liable to
injury by handling.
(2) Being wider at
the corners where
folded, they are
stronger. (3) Some
markets, being accustomed
to the
larger cases necessary
to contain a
given number of
beeway sections, object
to the smaller
package containing the same number of plain sections, simply because
it is smaller.</p>

</div>

<h4><a id="DIMENSIONS_OF_SECTIONS"></a><b>DIMENSIONS OF SECTIONS.</b></h4>

<p>Sections of various dimensions are in use by beekeepers, but the
sizes in general use are the 4<sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> inches square and the 4 by 5 inches.
Some producers prefer the 4 by 5 sections because of the more pleasing
appearance of the oblong package (<a href="#Fig_6">fig. 6</a>). The standard widths of
the 4<sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> by 4<sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> inches section are 1<sup>7</sup>/<sub>8</sub> inches in the beeway style and 1<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>
inches in the plain section. The extra width in the beeway style
is for the purpose of spacing and does not add to the thickness of the
comb. The 4 by 5 is 1<sup>3</sup>/<sub>8</sub> or 1<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> inches wide in the plain style and not
much used in the beeway style. The 1<sup>3</sup>/<sub>8</sub> width of the 4 by 5 section
contains practically the same amount of honey when filled as the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">« 12 »</a></span>
4<sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> by 4<sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> by 1<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> plain or the 4<sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> by 4<sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> by 1<sup>7</sup>/<sub>8</sub> beeway, assuming of course
that all are used with separators and filled under like conditions.
Since there are well-defined limits as to the thickness of the combs
most profitable to produce, the area of one comb surface in a section
weighing about a pound is usually from 16 to 20 square inches, the
exact size and shape being an adaptation to given space in the super.
The thinner combs, showing more comb surface, have the appearance
of being larger and a greater number can be accommodated on a
given hive. Honey in such combs may also be ripened sooner and
possibly better than in thicker combs. They, however, require more
foundation for each pound of honey produced and a slightly greater
amount of wax, in proportion to the honey, to complete them. Also
the thinner the comb, the greater the difficulty with the sheets of
foundation swinging to one side on account of uneven work on the
two sides or because the hives do not stand level.</p>

</div>

<h4><a id="SUPERS"></a><b>SUPERS.</b></h4>

<p>The main points of difference between the various types of comb-honey
supers are in (1) the method of supporting the sections, (2)
the amount of protection afforded to the outside of the section and
(3) the degree of free communication from section to section within
the super.</p>

<p class="center"><a id="The_Method_of_Support"></a><b>The Method of Support.</b></p>

<p>Sections are supported either by means of cross supports under
the ends of the sections or by a slat of proper width supporting each
row of sections. The T super (<a href="#Fig_7">fig. 7</a>), so called from the shape of a
cross section of the strip of tin used to support the sections is illustrative
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">« 13 »</a></span>
of the first, while the supporting slats, section holders (figs. <a href="#Fig_8">8</a>, <a href="#Fig_9">9</a> and <a href="#Fig_10">10</a>),
and wide frames (<a href="#Fig_11">fig. 11</a>) are illustrative of the second
type of support.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 474px;">
<a name="Fig_7"></a>
<img src="images/fig_7.png" width="474" height="225" alt="" />
<div class="fig_caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 7.</span>&mdash;The T super. (Original.)</div>
</div>

<p class="center"><a id="Protection"></a><b>Protection.</b></p>

<p>The T super and others of this type offer no protection against
propolizing to either the top or bottom of the sections, the section
holder or slat (figs. <a href="#Fig_8">8</a>, <a href="#Fig_9">9</a> and <a href="#Fig_10">10</a>) protects the bottom, while in the
wide frame (<a href="#Fig_11">fig. 11</a>) the entire outer surface of the sections is protected
except at the edges. The greater the protection afforded the
section, the more complicated and expensive the super, and the more
complicated supers require more labor in cleaning of propolis and
filling with sections. On the other hand, sections of honey produced
in properly constructed wide-frame supers are much more easily
cleaned of propolis, and ordinarily present a neater appearance when
packed for market.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">« 14 »</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><a id="Free_Communication"></a><b>Free Communication Within the Super.</b></p>

<p>The use of closed-top sections (1-beeway) and solid separators,
making each section a separate compartment with openings for the
bees at the bottom only, illustrates one extreme; while the sections
with openings on all four sides (4-beeway) used without separators
illustrate the other extreme as to free communication; and between
these extremes are various intermediate types.</p>

</div>

<p>It would be desirable so to adjust the sections that when filled
with honey a row of them would, so far as the bees are concerned,
be equivalent to a single comb, that the bees might have the same
free access to the outside row of cells from all sides as they do the
other cells and might pass up or down from any section and the
full length of the row, as well as around the ends. While, under the
same conditions, such free access to the outside row of cells from all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">« 15 »</a></span>
sides would result in the sections being slightly better filled than
with the ordinary adjustments, such an arrangement presents some
mechanical difficulties and would add considerable to the first cost
of the supers. If separators were not necessary, such an adjustment
of sections could be readily accomplished. In Europe a type of
separator having transverse openings corresponding to the upright
edges of the sections is used to give free communication lengthwise
of the row of sections. In this country some such separators are
used as well as a separator made of wire cloth so spaced between the
rows of sections as to give free communication along the rows, as well
as from one row to another. These, however, are not widely used in
the United States.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 480px;">
<a name="Fig_11"></a>

<div class="fig_caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 11.</span>&mdash;Combination super with wide frames for oblong plain sections. (Original.)</div>
</div>

<p>The plain section, when used in connection with the "fence"
separator (<a href="#Fig_4">fig. 4</a>), having the upright posts considerably shorter
than the height of the section, offers a fair compromise as to free
communication within the super. Most of the comb honey produced
in this country, however, is produced in sections which offer
no communication from section to section lengthwise of the super,
being produced in the regular 2-beeway section, having openings at
the top and bottom only (figs. <a href="#Fig_7">7</a> and <a href="#Fig_8">8</a>).</p>

<h4><a id="THE_USE_OF_SEPARATORS"></a><b>THE USE OF SEPARATORS.</b></h4>

<p>Separators are made of strips of tin or wood and are used between
the rows of sections to compel the tees to build the combs straight
and all within the section. The thicker the combs the greater becomes
the necessity for separators. While an expert can produce
very uniform comb honey without separators during a heavy honey
flow by using very narrow sections, it is usually not advisable to do
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">« 16 »</a></span>
so on account of the resulting large percentage of imperfect combs,
especially during poor and indifferent seasons and at the close of
any season. The use of separators results in a much more uniform
product.</p>

<h4><a id="SHALLOW_EXTRACTING_SUPERS"></a><b>SHALLOW EXTRACTING SUPERS.</b></h4>

<p>Some comb-honey producers add to their equipment one shallow
extracting super for each colony. These are a great convenience
in a comb-honey apiary and may be used for the following purposes:
(1) To keep the brood chamber free of honey before the beginning
of the main honey flow; (2) to use at the beginning of the honey flow
to induce the bees to begin work promptly in the supers; (3) to use
at the close of the honey flow instead of the last comb-honey super;
(4) to use during any flow of inferior honey or honeydew; (5) to use
during very poor seasons when first-class comb honey can not be
produced.</p>

<h4><a id="COMBINATION_SUPERS"></a><b>COMBINATION SUPERS.</b></h4>

<p>Other comb-honey producers provide each comb-honey super with
two shallow extracting combs. These are placed one on each side
of the super with the sections between them (<a href="#Fig_11">fig. 11</a>). The purpose
of this arrangement is to induce the bees to begin work in the
super promptly without the use of "bait sections" (sections containing
comb previously drawn) or an extracting super and also to
do away with the usual poorly finished sections in the corners and
outside rows. One great advantage of this system over the use of
an extracting super to start early super work is that the combs are
not removed. When shallow extracting supers are used for this
purpose, they are removed as soon as the bees have started well in
them and a comb-honey super substituted. This brings back much
the same conditions existing before giving the extracting super, and
while some colonies will begin work in the sections promptly when
the change is made, many colonies hesitate about beginning the new
work almost as though the extracting super had not been used.
Such colonies are thus thrown out of "condition", (<a href="#Page_19">p. 19</a>) and may
begin preparations to swarm. The use of these combs in supers
that are added subsequently allows the apiarist to place the empty
super over the one already on the hive until the bees begin work
therein without seriously crowding the super room, because each
super thus added contains room in the form of empty comb into
which the new nectar may be stored at once (see <a href="#Page_42">p. 42</a>).</p>


<h3><a id="Other_Apparatus"></a><b>Other Apparatus.</b></h3>

<p>Among the other apparatus needed in commercial comb-honey
production are a honey extractor, wax press, bee-escapes, and escape
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">« 17 »</a></span>
boards (<a href="#Fig_12">fig. 12</a>), queen-excluding honey boards (<a href="#Fig_2">fig. 2</a>), feeders, tools,
etc. It is not necessary to provide queen-excluding honey boards
for each colony unless some special system is followed, yet a few
excluders are very desirable for various special manipulations. Good
feeders may be had by using tin pans in connection with an
empty super. A handful of grass should be placed on the sirup to
prevent the bees from drowning. In addition to these appliances
in the northern States, if the hives are single walled, some means of
protection is necessary if the colonies are wintered out of doors.</p>

<h3><a id="Preparing_Supers"></a><b>Preparing Supers.</b></h3>

<h4><a id="FOLDING_SECTIONS"></a><b>FOLDING SECTIONS.</b></h4>

<p>Section presses and foundation fasteners are sometimes combined
in one machine by which the section is pressed together square and
the foundation is fastened by
a single operation. Usually,
however, they are separate
machines requiring that each
section be handled twice before
it is ready to be placed
into the super. Ordinarily
the one-piece sections must be
dampened before folding, as
otherwise the breakage is considerable
and the sections are
greatly weakened by folding.
A crate of sections as it comes
from the factory may be dampened
by removing one side so
as to expose the V-shaped
grooves, then directing a small
stream of hot water into these
grooves. Care should be taken
that only the thin portion
where the section is folded be dampened. Another very satisfactory
method of dampening sections is to wrap the crates containing them
in a wet blanket the day before they are to be folded.</p>

<h4><a id="FASTENING_FOUNDATION"></a><b>FASTENING FOUNDATION IN SECTIONS.</b></h4>

<p>The use of comb foundation in full sheets filling each section as
nearly as possible is considered a necessity in the production of fancy
comb honey. This foundation should be as thin as can be used without
being gnawed or torn down by the bees. The sheet of foundation
is usually fastened centrally at the top of the section, leaving only
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">« 18 »</a></span>
enough space at the sides to allow it to swing freely without binding
and about three-sixteenths to one-fourth inch at the bottom to allow for
stretching while being drawn out. To secure better attachment of the
comb to the bottom of the section, a bottom starter about five-eighths
inch wide may be used. In this case the top starter should reach to
within three-sixteenths to one-fourth inch of the bottom starter. In
some localities the character of the flow is such that but little is gained
by the use of the bottom starter, while in other localities it is difficult
to produce honey that will stand shipment well without it.</p>

<p>The various types of apparatus usually used for fastening foundation
in the sections make use of a heated metal plate which, after
melting the edge of the sheet of foundation, is withdrawn, allowing
the melted edge to be brought quickly in contact with the section.
This fastens one edge of the sheet of foundation firmly to the wood.
Foundation fasteners employing this principle may be simply a hand
apparatus consisting of a metal plate of proper size provided with a
handle, the operator transferring the tool from the source of heat to
the edge of the foundation. Or the principle may be incorporated in
a more or less complex machine which provides for the maintenance of
the proper temperature of the heated plate, its movement to melt the
edge of the foundation and a proper support for the section and foundation
during the process. For the purpose of securing better filled
sections of honey various methods of attaching the sheet of foundation
to the sides as well as the top of the section have been devised,
but are not extensively used by producers. Among these methods
are fitting the sheet of foundation in place, then directing a fine stream
of melted wax along its edges, or the use of split sections in which a
sheet of foundation is continuous through a row of sections, extending
through their sides and top.</p>

<p>Some super construction is such that the sections may be placed
directly into the super by the operator who puts in the foundation.
This work is usually done during the winter months when the bees
require no special attention. Enough supers should be provided to
take care of the largest possible crop, even though it is not often that
all are used the same season. The beekeeper who is operating
several apiaries can not afford to take time to prepare supers for the
bees during a good honey flow. Supers of sections thus prepared in
advance should be kept clean by storing them in piles and keeping
the piles covered from dust.</p>

<h2><a name="MANIPULATION_OF_THE_BEES" id="MANIPULATION_OF_THE_BEES"><b>MANIPULATION OF THE BEES.</b></a></h2>


<p>It is important to note that there are four essential factors entering
into the securing of a crop of honey: (1) A sufficient amount of
bloom of healthy and well-nourished nectar-secreting plants growing
in sou to which they are adapted and within range of the apiary.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">« 19 »</a></span>
(2) Weather conditions favorable to nectar secretion and bee flight.
(3) A large number of workers in excess of those needed for the routine
work of the colony. (4) Conditions of the colony making the
storing instinct dominant. If any one of these factors is absent, the
effect of the other three is immediately nullified, and the amount of
honey secured will vary as these factors are present at the same time
in greater or less degree or as the time during which they are all
present is longer or shorter. It is therefore possible to have each of
these factors present at some time during the season without securing
a crop of honey and the period of time during which they are all
present at the same time is usually quite short.</p>

<p>Grouping the first and second factors we have a combination
usually spoken of as the locality and season. These factors are largely
beyond the control of the beekeeper except as he may choose a location
in which both are usually present at some time or times during
the season, may take advantage of the plants of several locations by
practising migratory beekeeping, or may improve a given locality by
directly or indirectly increasing the amount of nectar-secreting plants,
such as buckwheat, alsike clover, sweet clover, or alfalfa.</p>

<p>Grouping the third and fourth factors we have conditions capable
of being brought about by manipulation and for which the beekeeper
is more directly responsible. The beekeeper's skill therefore lies in
supplying and maintaining these factors throughout the short period
during which the bees may store more than they consume. He should
know which plants may be expected to furnish the nectar for his crop
of honey, that his various manipulations may be properly timed. It
should be noted that the shorter the duration of the honey flow, the
greater becomes the necessity of having the colonies in proper condition
at its beginning and keeping them so until its close. However
lavish nature may be with the secretion of nectar and fine weather, it
is of little avail if the beekeeper fails to secure a large force of workers
to gather and store his crop or, even having provided workers, if he
fails to keep his forces together and contented, bending all their energy
in the one direction of gathering and storing honey. It is a common
occurrence among inexperienced beekeepers to have the colonies
become strong enough to work in the supers only after the flowers
have ceased blooming or to see strong colonies during a good honey
flow doing nothing in the supers simply because conditions are not
such as to make the storing instinct dominant.</p>

<p>So far as the skill of the beekeeper is concerned in the production of
the crop of honey in a given location, every manipulation of the season
should be directed (1) toward securing the greatest possible number
of vigorous workers at the proper time, and (2) keeping the entire
working force of each colony together and contentedly at work
throughout the given honey flow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">« 20 »</a></span></p>


<h3><a id="Securing_Workers"></a><b>Securing Workers for the Honey Flow.</b></h3>

<p>Of course, the shorter the period for brood rearing previous to the
honey flow, the more serious the problem of getting the colonies
strong enough. Adverse weather conditions greatly retard brood
rearing and thus have the effect of shortening this period. On the
other hand, in some localities the main honey flow comes so late in
the season that the colonies may even be divided and both divisions
built up.</p>

<p>In most comb-honey localities the season is short and there is
usually during the season only one honey flow that furnishes any
considerable surplus suitable for comb honey, with perhaps other
honey flows either very meager or furnishing honey unsuitable in
color. The early minor flows are in such localities utilized in brood
rearing in preparation for the main flow, and those occurring after the
main flow may be utilized for winter stores, or if sufficient in quantity
some surplus may be secured. In localities where the season is made
up of a series of honey flows of almost equal importance and with
sometimes a long interval between, the problem of securing workers
for the harvest is rendered more complex, since the process must be
repeated for each crop or the colonies kept very strong throughout
the season. As a rule such localities are not the best for comb-honey
production.</p>

<p>The workers that gather and store the crop of honey are those
that emerge during the few weeks preceding and during the first
part of the honey flow. Unless it is of unusual duration, the eggs
that produce these workers are all laid before the honey flow begins,
since those which develop from eggs laid later are not ready for
work until after the close of the flow. On the other hand, the workers
that emerge six weeks or more before the honey flow will have died
of old age or be too old to be of much value during the flow. Their
services, however, are of great value provided they expend their
energy to the best possible advantage in rearing brood. If brood
rearing ceases or is greatly restricted during this period, a colony
that has been strong earlier in the season is rendered almost worthless
as gatherers, since it begins the harvest with old and worn-out
workers. This is exactly what often happens unless the beekeeper
is alert and provides conditions such that brood rearing is not restricted
during this period. In the clover belt, for example, it
frequently happens that there is a scarcity of nectar during the
period when the workers for the harvest should be reared and, unless
the colonies are abundantly supplied with stores, brood rearing is
greatly restricted. This may to some extent justify the saying
among beekeepers that if the early flowers yield well the season
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">« 21 »</a></span>
will be good. The progressive beekeeper, however, provides conditions
favorable to brood rearing even though the early flowers fail
to yield nectar. It is therefore highly important (1) that each
colony be in a normal condition at a period six or eight weeks previous
to the honey flow, and (2) that brood rearing be at its maximum
for the entire period of six or eight weeks during which the brood is
reared to produce workers available for the honey flow.</p>

<h4><a id="BUILDING_UP_THE_COLONY"></a><b>BUILDING UP THE COLONY IN THE EARLY SPRING.</b></h4>

<p>The condition of the colonies in the early spring depends upon
many factors not all of which are under the control of the beekeeper.
In the white-clover belt for  instance, where the honey flow comes
early, a large percentage of strong colonies in early spring means of
course that they have wintered well, which in turn is largely dependent
upon proper conditions the previous late summer and autumn. The
manipulations having for their purpose the rapid upbuilding of the
colony may therefore have their beginning at or even before the
close of the honey flow of the previous year, including late summer
and fall management and wintering. Good queens, preferably
young, with enough room for breeding purposes and a supply of
stores during the previous late summer and autumn are among the
factors favoring good wintering. During the winter the central
idea is the conservation of the energy of the bees, the complex details
of which can not be presented in this paper.</p>

<p>The rapidity with which the colonies build up in early spring
depends upon a number of conditions, some of which are: (1) The
number and vitality of the workers; (2) the age and fecundity of the
queen; (3) the supply and location of stores within the hive; (4)
weather conditions; (5) the supply of new pollen, nectar, and water;
(6) the conservation of heat within the brood nest; (7) the race of
bees; (8) the character of the brood combs, etc. Most of these conditions
are to a great extent within the control of the beekeeper.
By supplying each colony with a young queen the previous autumn,
or at least supplanting all undesirable ones, a greater number of
young and vigorous workers are reared late in the season, which
usually means greater vitality and numbers the next spring. Young
queens reared the previous summer or autumn should be in prime
condition the next spring. If to this combination is added an
abundance of stores within the hives, brood rearing should progress
rapidly, even in spite of adverse weather conditions. It is now the
general practice among beekeepers to supply enough stores the
previous autumn not only for winter stores but for brood-rearing
purposes the next spring. Since the amount consumed during the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">« 22 »</a></span>
winter varies considerably with different colonies, an early examination
to determine the amount of stores may be necessary. Under
some conditions it may be found profitable to stimulate brood rearing
early in the spring by slowly feeding diluted sugar sirup to each
colony, by spreading brood, or by doing both, but any very early
stimulation of this kind should be used with caution. Among
extensive beekeepers the tendency is decidedly toward letting the
bees alone until the weather is more settled, simply making sure
that they have sufficient stores. The apiary should, if possible, be
so located that the bees may have access to water without the necessity
of exposure of a long flight during bad weather. In localities
that do not furnish natural pollen, it may be necessary to feed an
artificial substitute, such as rye meal. A good hive that will conserve
the heat of the cluster is also a great help in early brood rearing.
Some beekeepers who winter their colonies in the cellar in
single-walled hives find it profitable to give them some additional
protection after they have been removed from the cellar. In the
northern States double-walled hives are especially advantageous
during the spring. A protected location for the apiary in some
instances makes a great difference in early brood rearing. Some
races breed up more rapidly in the spring than others. The Italians
are somewhat conservative in this respect, but have so many excellent
traits that they are generally used in this country. In localities
having intermittent honey flows Italian bees may not give the best
results because of their tendency to restrict brood rearing during the
honey flow by crowding the queen and to curtail the production of
brood during a scarcity of nectar. Drone comb within the brood nest
in early spring is a decided barrier to rapid brood rearing. Many brood
combs considered by the average beekeeper to be perfect contain,
especially in the upper portion, a large percentage of cells which
can not be used for rearing worker brood because of imperfections
in shape and size due to the stretching of this portion of the combs
during hot weather. This suggests the advisability of the use of a
heavier grade of foundation or some method of using vertical wires
or wooden splints in the upper half of the sheet of foundation.</p>

<h4><a id="PRODUCTION"></a><b>THE PRODUCTION OF GATHERING BEES.</b></h4>

<p>During the six or eight weeks just preceding the honey flow every
colony should be encouraged to rear the greatest possible amount of
brood. Brood rearing during this period is often restricted by insufficient
stores or by insufficient room. It is therefore of great importance
that both stores and available brood-rearing space be supplied in
abundance. If stimulative feeding or spreading the brood is practiced,
this is the time it should be done.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">« 23 »</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><a id="Providing_Sufficient_Stores"></a><b>Providing Sufficient Stores.</b></p>

<p>If feeding is not practiced during this critical period, the beekeeper
should see that each colony is at all times supplied with a reserve of
stores, for surprisingly large quantities are consumed when brood
rearing is going on rapidly. If any colonies should run short, brood
rearing will be carried on sparingly and the colony so severely crippled
that it may not recover its strength until after the honey flow
is over.</p>

<p>Whether stimulative feeding or supplying each colony with an
abundance of reserve stores is the more profitable depends upon
circumstances and must be decided by each beekeeper for his own
conditions. Stimulative feeding, if properly done, will undoubtedly
result in the rearing of more bees for the harvest. When the beekeeper
is operating several apiaries and must travel some distance
to reach them the labor involved is considerable, and the question
to be decided is whether this labor would yield greater returns if
expended in stimulative feeding or in operating a larger number of
colonies. If the brood chamber is large and well provisioned or if
the flowers furnish some nectar in early spring the colonies may have
sufficient stores for this period of heavy brood rearing. Some beekeepers
save combs of honey of the previous year to supply food for
this period. This is one of the most convenient and satisfactory
methods of feeding.</p>

<p class="center"><a id="Providing_Available"></a><b>Providing Available Brood-Rearing Space.</b></p>

<p>There should be no restriction whatever in the room for brood
rearing up to the time of putting on the supers, just previous to the
honey flow, for a crowded brood nest at this time tends to diminish
the number of workers available for the honey flow as well as to
encourage swarming.</p>

<p>If the space for brood rearing should be restricted by too much
early honey in the brood chamber some of the heaviest combs should
be removed and empty ones given instead, or an extra brood chamber
containing empty combs may be given. In localities where considerable
early honey is gathered the brood chamber may be kept
almost free of honey by placing an extracting super over each colony
at the beginning of such a flow. This super should not be removed
until the comb-honey supers are given, for the honey may be needed
later in brood rearing.</p>

<p>Should the brood nest be restricted by a small brood chamber
the colonies may be equalized by removing some frames of brood
from the stronger colonies, exchanging them for empty combs taken
from weaker colonies, or another brood chamber filled with empty
combs may be given, thus building the colonies up individually.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">« 24 »</a></span>
The former method has the following advantages: (1) After being
built up to approximately the same strength, most of the colonies
will be ready for a given manipulation at the same time, thus facilitating
the work. (2) It requires a smaller stock of extra brood
chambers and combs, at least previous to the honey flow. (3) The
brood is in a more compact form, which is a very desirable condition
in comb-honey production. (4) When properly done, the total
number of young bees reared in a given time is probably considerably
greater, owing to the fact that none of the colonies is strong beyond
the capacity of the queen, the workers of the entire apiary being so
distributed that all the queens are utilized to the best possible advantage.
(5) When the honey flow begins the colonies are ready for
the supers without additional manipulation, such as removing extra
brood chambers, sorting combs of brood, etc. In equalizing colonies
combs of hatching brood with the adhering workers, <i>without the queen</i>,
are usually drawn from the strongest colonies and given to colonies
less strong, but <i>never to very weak colonies</i>. The weakest colonies
are left until the last, then built up quickly, provided there is time
enough to have all the hives well filled with brood. If this is not
possible the very weak colonies can more profitably be used for purposes
other than comb-honey production. Another plan of equalizing
is that of shaking bees from combs taken from strong colonies at
the entrance of colonies less strong. The older bees at once take
wing and return to their hives, while the younger bees enter the
weaker colony. The operator must, of course, be sure that the queen
is not on the comb thus shaken.</p>

<p>Some of the advantages of building up the colonies as individuals
are: (1) The labor required is considerably less, fewer visits being
required, so that this method is particularly adapted to out-apiary
conditions. (2) It is possible to determine with much greater
accuracy which colonies show the most desirable traits for breeding
purposes. (3) It can be more safely practiced if brood diseases are
imminent.</p>

<h4><a id="SUMMARY"></a><b>SUMMARY.</b></h4>

<p>(1) The workers that take part in storing a crop of honey from any
given honey flow are usually those reared within the period of six or
eight weeks just preceding the honey flow. The workers reared
previous to this period are too old to be of much value as gatherers
while those reared after this period mature after the flow has ceased.</p>

<p>(2) It is necessary that the beekeeper know what plants are likely
to furnish the surplus honey and their approximate period of bloom
so that he can determine the limits of the heavy brood-rearing period
in order to secure the largest possible working force for the honey
flow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">« 25 »</a></span></p>

<p>(3) Colonies should be in a normal condition at the beginning of this
period. (<i>a</i>) If the surplus is from an early flow, this normal condition
can be obtained only by proper management the previous late summer
and autumn, together with good wintering. Good queens, preferably
young, together with sufficient room for brood rearing and winter
stores, are important conditions during late summer and autumn.
(<i>b</i>) Stores and protection are important factors in early brood rearing.
(<i>c</i>) The character of the brood combs and the race of bees each
have some influence upon brood rearing.</p>

<p>(4) During the time that workers for the harvest should be reared
brood rearing should be constantly accelerated.</p>

<p>(5) Brood rearing is often restricted during this period (<i>a</i>) because
of limited stores and (<i>b</i>) because of limited room in the brood chamber.</p>


<h3><a id="Using_Available_Workers"></a><b>Using Available Workers to Best Advantage During the Honey Flow.</b></h3>

<p>Brood rearing, which is of primary importance during the preceding
period, becomes of secondary consideration at about the beginning of
the honey flow, because this is nearing the limit beyond which time
the resulting bees develop too late to take part in gathering and storing
the crop of honey. At this time, therefore, there is a radical change
in purpose of the manipulations. Instead of continuing the expansion
of the brood chamber, the policy of the beekeeper should now
be rather a concentration of the workers and brood. There is perhaps
a limit to the number of workers that can be profitably kept in a single
hive and set of supers, but this limit is seldom reached, the usual
mistake being in having too few. Each colony should have its brood
chamber well filled with brood in a compact form and be so crowded
with young and vigorous workers that they will immediately occupy
the supers when the honey flow actually begins. The brood chamber
of colonies occupying more than one hive body should at this time
be reduced to one, any extra brood being used in colonies having less
than one brood chamber full of brood. After this operation, should
there still be some colonies left with the brood chamber but partly
filled with brood, they should be filled with combs of brood and
adhering bees (without the queen) drawn from some colony or colonies
too weak to work well in comb-honey supers.</p>

<p>It may be advisable to unite the weaker colonies in order to secure
the proper strength for the best work. This massing of the workers
in strong colonies, so essential to the production of a fancy grade of
comb honey, renders necessary extremely careful and skillful management,
since the efforts of the beekeeper may still be nullified in
either of two ways: (1) The bees may divide their forces by swarming
into two or more parts, neither of which would be ready to work
in the supers until the season is much advanced or perhaps closed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">« 26 »</a></span>
entirely, or (2) being balked in their desire to swarm or from lack of
convenient storage space, etc., they may do very poor work even during
a good honey flow simply because the conditions of the colony are
such that the storing instinct is not dominant. <i>To bring about the
best results in comb honey, the entire working force of each colony must
be kept undivided and the means employed in doing so must be such
that the storing instinct remains dominant throughout any given honey
flow.</i> Any increase made before or during the flow<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> is made at the
expense of the surplus honey unless it be made with brood that
would emerge too late for the young bees to be of use during the honey
flow (<a href="#Page_31">p. 31</a>). In general, however, increase may be made at much
less expense by setting aside some of the colonies for that purpose.
To keep the forces together and satisfied, with the storing instinct
dominant during a good flow, is the most difficult problem with which
the producer of comb honey must deal.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_3" id="Footnote_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> In localities where the main honey flow is so late that colonies may be divided long enough before the
flow so that both colonies may be built up to proper strength in time to take advantage of it, of course
increase previous to the flow would be advisable. This condition is rare in comb-honey localities.</p></div>


<h3><a id="Swarming"></a><b>Swarming.</b></h3>

<p>All colonies do not behave alike as to swarming. (1) There are
certain colonies that go through the season with apparently no
thought of swarming. Such colonies do the very best work in the
supers, and their number can be increased by skillful management.
(2) Other colonies start queen cells preparatory to swarming, but can
be persuaded to give it up by such mild measures as destroying the
queen cells and perhaps removing a few frames of brood. (3) Certain
colonies are determined to swarm and, unless the flow ceases,
nothing short of swarming or some radical manipulation will satisfy
them. (4) A certain percentage of queens fail during the honey flow
and swarming may occur in connection with the supersedure. Such
colonies usually do very poor work in comb-honey supers.</p>

<p>The beekeeper can do much (1) toward increasing the percentage
in the first group and discouraging those of the second&mdash;<i>preventive
measures</i>, and (2) toward making the most of the colonies under the
third and fourth groups&mdash;<i>control measures</i>.</p>

<h4><a id="PREVENTIVE_MEASURES"></a><b>PREVENTIVE MEASURES.</b></h4>

<p>Some effort has been made toward the final elimination of swarming
by breeding from colonies showing the least disposition to swarm.
Although after years of selection bees continue to swarm when conditions
are favorable, many practical beekeepers testify to having
greatly reduced the percentage of swarming colonies by years of careful
selection and breeding. It would certainly seem advisable to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">« 27 »</a></span>
replace the queens of all colonies which persist in swarming with
young queens reared from colonies less inclined to swarm. The
swarming problem has also been attacked from the standpoint of
the hive and mechanical attachments, finally resulting in the invention
of a "nonswarming" hive. More attention has, however, been
paid to the prevention and control of swarming by manipulation than
along either of the other fines, probably because proper manipulation
gives immediate results and is now available as a means of preventing
the losses due to swarming. The success in swarm control attained
by the best beekeepers is a result of some effort along all three of the
above fines at the same time.</p>

<p>Among the manipulations that tend to discourage swarming are (1)
the introduction of young queens (preferably reared from selected
stock); (2) an abundance of empty comb in the brood chamber at all
times previous to the honey flow; (3) prompt work in the supers at the
beginning of the flow induced by using "bait sections" or extracting
combs in the first super given, thus tiding the colony over one of the
critical periods; (4) a judicious manipulation of the supers during
the honey flow (<a href="#Page_41">p. 41</a>); (5) the use of more nearly perfect worker
combs in the brood chamber, since drone comb and imperfect cells
(<a href="#Page_22">p. 22</a>) have the effect of contracting the brood chamber, thus bringing
about a crowded condition; (6) an abundance of ventilation during
the honey flow, obtained by means of a large entrance or by raising
the hive above the bottom board by means of small blocks; (7) protection
of the hive from direct rays of the sun during the hottest
portion of the day by some such means as a double cover or shade
board; (8) the removal of one or two frames of brood and the substitution
therefor of empty combs or sheets of foundation; (9) the
destruction of all queen cells provided they contain only eggs or very
small larvæ.</p>

<p>If queen cells are well advanced, their destruction usually has little
or no effect as a swarm preventive measure. While destroying
queen cells in their early stages can not be relied upon as a preventive
of swarming, beekeepers who practice examining the brood chambers
once a week for queen cells during the swarming season are usually
surprised at the number of colonies that can be induced to give up
swarming and turn their attention to storing in this way. Such a
result at least partly compensates for the large amount of labor
required for these weekly examinations.</p>

<h4><a id="CONTROL_MEASURES"></a><b>CONTROL MEASURES.</b></h4>

<p>After having taken all precautions as to preventive measures there
win still be some colonies that will attempt to swarm when producing
comb honey. During poor seasons of course the percentage may be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">« 28 »</a></span>
quite low, but during good seasons the conditions are sometimes such
that a majority of the colonies may make an effort to swarm. Swarming
colonies, however, may be controlled in such a manner that
practically as much surplus honey is secured as if the colony made no
attempt to swarm. If but a single apiary is being operated and the
beekeeper is present during the swarming season, the bees may be
permitted to swarm naturally without loss to the beekeeper; but if
several apiaries are being operated, it is more economical to employ
some method by which swarming may be controlled by visiting each
apiary at given intervals during the swarming season, rather than to
have an attendant at each.</p>

<p class="center"><a id="Control_of_Natural_Swarms"></a><b>Control of Natural Swarms.</b></p>

<p>Natural swarms may be managed (1) by allowing them to cluster
naturally, then hiving them in the ordinary manner; (2) by the
clipped queen method; (3) by the use of queen traps (<a href="#Fig_13">fig. 13</a>; see
Farmers' Bulletin No.
447, pp. 29-30); or (4)
by use of the swarm
catcher.<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_4" id="Footnote_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4"><span class="label">[4]</span></a> This is simply a wire-cloth cage large enough to be set over the hive or be fitted over the entrance. If
the attendant is provided with a number of these catchers he can avoid the usual confusion ordinarily
occurring when several swarms issue at about the same time. After being caught in this manner the
swarms may be hived at the convenience of the beekeeper.</p></div>

<p>To keep the forces together
(1) the swarm
without the queen may
be returned to its hive,
the queen cells destroyed
a week later, and the colony afterwards requeened (<a href="#Page_36">p. 36</a>); or

after which the swarm with the queen is returned. The former
method is useful under some conditions (<a href="#Page_37">p. 37</a>), but the latter is
the one usually preferred.</p>

<p>When the swarm is hived back without the brood on its old location
in this manner, the colony does not lose any of its flying bees and is
back at work with renewed energy in the same set of supers it was but a
few minutes before so eagerly deserting. Instead of removing the
combs from the brood chamber the usual practice is the removal of the
entire brood chamber and the substitution of another whose external
appearance is the same. This method of swarm management keeps
the bees, queen, and supers together and is one of the most satisfactory
known. It is not, however, adapted to out-apiaries or any apiaries
not having an attendant, and requires considerable time in watching
for and hiving swarms.</p>

<p class="center"><a id="USING_THE_REMOVED_BROOD"></a><b>USING THE REMOVED BROOD TO BEST ADVANTAGE.</b></p>

<p>The disposition of the brood that is left when a swarm issues should
be such that (1) no "after-swarms" (swarms resulting from the
emergence of a plurality of virgin queens) are permitted to issue and
(2) that the emerging workers may be
used to the best advantage.</p>

<p>"After-swarming" may be prevented
by (1) breaking up the parent colony before
any of the young queens emerge,
using the unhatched brood elsewhere, (2)
by destroying all queen cells but one before
any young queens emerge, or (3) by
greatly reducing the population of the parent
colony<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> just before the young queens
emerge.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_5" id="Footnote_5"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5"><span class="label">[5]</span></a> The term "parent colony" applies to the one in the hive from which the swarm issues and is in common
use, though the correctness of the term is questionable.</p></div>

(Original.)</div>
</div>

<p>If swarming occurs at a time when the
resulting young bees can take part in gathering
and storing the crop of honey, the
usual practice is to allow the brood to emerge in a separate hive and later
to add these young bees to the colony from which it was taken. Under
such circumstances this reenforcement of the swarm is especially desirable,
since otherwise its forces are constantly diminishing during the 21
days (the time required for worker brood to develop) immediately
following the removal of all its brood. The brood, however, may be
used anywhere in
the apiary and
should be placed
where the resulting
bees will be most
needed. The plans
given below make
use of at least a
part of the emerging
bees in reenforcing
the swarm from
which the brood was
taken.</p>

<p>When hiving natural swarms on the
old location as suggested above, the old brood chamber is provided
with a bottom and cover and set aside, usually with its entrance
turned away about 90° from its former position (figs. <a href="#Fig_14">14</a>, <a href="#Fig_15">15</a>). This
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">« 30 »</a></span>
is to prevent any field bees returning to the parent colony. A
day or so later it is turned about 45° toward its former position
(<a href="#Fig_16">fig. 16</a>) and as soon as the bees have this location of the entrance
well marked the hive is placed parallel to the hive on the old stand
(<a href="#Fig_17">fig. 17</a>). So far as the
bees returning from the
field are concerned, these
two colonies are now on
the same stand.</p>

<p>The further disposition
of the remnant of the
brood and young bees
may be by any one of
the following methods:
(1) One week after the
swarm issues, or just before
the parent colony
would cast a second or
"after-swarm," it may,
when the bees are well at
work in the fields, be removed and given a new location. This
throws the entire flying force into the colony having the supers,
where they are of greatest service, and so depletes the other colony
of its flying bees just when the young queens are emerging that
"after-swarming" is usually prevented. (2) Before moving it, away
the parent colony may be more
thoroughly depleted of its
young bees by shaking most
of them from their combs,
adding them of course to the
colony with the supers. The
comb containing the finest
queen cells should not be
shaken, since to do so will
probably injure the immature
queens. Two or three frames
should be left with their adhering
bees in order that the
parent colony will still contain
enough workers to care for the
remaining unemerged brood. (3) Instead of moving the parent colony
away as in (1) above, the bees may all be added to the swarm by shaking
them from their combs, and the combs then distributed among nuclei
previously prepared. By successive additions of frames of brood
these nuclei are finally built up into full colonies and "after-swarming"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">« 31 »</a></span>
is prevented. (4) Instead of giving the parent colony a new location,
as in (1) above, it may be shifted to the opposite side of the swarm on
the old stand (<a href="#Fig_18">fig. 18</a>) and by thus shifting it from one side to the
other at intervals of several days the young bees as they hatch and
learn to fly will finally all be added to the colony with the supers.
Few beekeepers, however, go to this extreme, as the season usually
closes before the latest emerging young bees are thus transferred to
the colony with the supers and these later-emerging bees may be
used for increase at little if any expense in surplus honey. (5) If
increase is not desired, the bees may be added to the swarm on the old
stand as before, and after 10 or 15 days the combs of the parent
colony still containing some unhatched brood may be used on which
to hive another swarm. Before being used for this purpose the bees
are of course shaken from these combs and added as before to the
swarm on the old stand. (6) If the honey flow is of long duration or
conditions otherwise such that
the storing colony may prepare
to swarm again, the brood chamber
of the parent colony may be
left by the side of the swarm (<a href="#Fig_18">fig. 18</a>)
until the young queen begins
to lay, then restored to its original
position on the old stand and
the supers transferred to it. The
brood chamber containing the
old queen is moved to one side,
its flying bees thus induced to
enter the hive containing the
young queen. The two colonies
may afterwards be united or the one containing the old queen may
finally be moved to a new location for increase. If, when using
this plan, a virgin queen or a ripe queen cell is given the parent
colony just after the swarm issues, this colony is ready to be restored
to its original position on the old stand about a week earlier than if
left to requeen itself.</p>

<div class="fig_caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 18.</span>&mdash;Hive with brood placed on other side of

</div>

<p>In case the emerging bees are not to be added to the storing colony
the brood and young bees may be used in one of the following ways:</p>

<p>(1) They may be used immediately after the swarm issues to build up
such colonies as are not strong enough to work in the supers or to
build up previously prepared nuclei, as in (3) above. Before being
used in these ways the adhering bees are usually added to the swarm.</p>

<p>(2) The parent colony may be placed at once on a new stand and given
a laying or virgin queen. To allow such a colony to requeen itself
usually results in its casting an "after-swarm," since it becomes quite
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">« 32 »</a></span>
populous again before the young queens emerge. This plan does
not make immediate use of the emerging bees but may be useful under
some conditions. (3) If the honey flow is of long duration or is
followed closely by a second, two parent colonies, as in (2) above,
may be placed upon the same stand, one of which is given a queen
but with the queen cells destroyed in the other. After two or three
weeks the bees may be shaken from the queenless colony in with the
queen-right one. Such colonies are in excellent condition for rapid
work in the supers.</p>

<p class="center"><a id="WHAT_TO_USE_IN_THE_BROOD"></a><b>WHAT TO USE IN THE BROOD CHAMBER WHEN HIVING SWARMS.</b></p>

<p>(1) The use of narrow strips of foundation 1 inch or less in width
in the brood chamber offers some advantages. (<i>a</i>) When the brood
chamber contains only these narrow "starters" and supers of partly
filled sections are transferred from the parent colony to the new swarm
at the time of hiving, there being no cells below in which to store the
honey, it is taken to the supers. Under these conditions work in the
brood chamber goes on slowly, the work of the colony being largely
in the supers. (<i>b</i>) Colonies that are thus required to construct a set
of new combs in the brood chamber and that are supplied with sufficient
storage room seldom attempt to swarm again during the same
season, even though the flow be of long duration. (<i>c</i>) The treatment
of brood diseases may be combined with swarm control. (See
Farmers' Bulletin No. 442, p. 14.) The greatest objection to their use
is in the excessive amount of drone comb usually built when anything
less than full sheets of foundation are used, especially if the queen is old
or the brood chamber large in proportion to the size of the swarm.</p>

<p>(2) The use of full sheets of foundation in the brood frames has
the decided advantage of resulting in straight combs having the
maximum number of cells of the worker size, but is more expensive
than the narrow strips and allows a more rapid building of comb in
the brood chamber, which under some conditions is considered a disadvantage.</p>

<p>(3) The exclusive use of either narrow strips or full sheets of
foundation in the brood chamber when hiving swarms necessitates
the use for a short time of a queen excluder (<a href="#Fig_2">fig. 2</a>) if the supers are
transferred from the parent colony to the swarm at the time of
hiving, since otherwise the queen would probably enter the sections
and a brood nest be established there. To avoid the use of queen
excluders for this purpose, one or more empty combs maybe used
in each brood chamber, the remaining frames containing full sheets
of foundation. This empty comb also serves as a storage place for
pollen that may be gathered before the other combs of the brood
chamber are constructed. Otherwise this pollen may be stored in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">« 33 »</a></span>
the sections (<a href="#Page_46">p. 46</a>). It is also probable that fewer colonies will
"swarm out" or desert their hives if hived in a brood chamber containing
one or more empty combs than if foundation only is used.
A disadvantage of this plan is that the cells near the top bar of the
comb may be so elongated as to interfere with the complete drawing
out of the foundation in the adjacent frame. Empty combs can
not well be used in connection with narrow strips of foundation, since
their use favors the construction of drone comb.</p>

<p>(4) Empty combs are sometimes used with the idea of saving the
bees the work of constructing a new set of combs. Under same conditions
this is false economy and gives poorer results than starters
or foundation. With very strong colonies, or with the brood
chamber contracted to five or six frames, empty combs in the
brood chamber may give good results. Medium colonies on a full
set of empty combs are included to store the honey in the brood
chamber and neglect the supers.</p>

<p>(5) Combs of honey are sometimes used on which to hive swarms.
In some instances the beekeeper uses frames of foundation or empty
combs above the brood chamber previous to and during the first few
days of the honey, flow for the purpose of discouraging swarming and
afterwards uses these partly filled combs on which to hive swarms.
In order to make room for the queen, this honey is rapidly carried
above, and stored in the sections.</p>

<p>(6) Combs of sealed brood in which no eggs have been laid during
the previous 10 days or 2 weeks may be used. Such combs are
usually available toward the close of the swarming season from
colonies that have swarmed 10 days or 2 weeks before. This
plan is especially desirable when the beekeeper runs short of hives
during the swarming season. In some localities, however, the
character of the flow is such that the colonies may later again prepare
to swarm when hived on either empty combs or combs of sealed
brood.</p>

<p class="center"><a id="EXTREME_CONTRACTION"></a><b>EXTREME CONTRACTION OF THE BROOD CHAMBER WHEN HIVING SWARMS.</b></p>

<p>Some beekeepers contract the brood chamber, when hiving swarms,
to five or six frames, the remaining space being filled by means of
division boards or "dummies." This reduction in the capacity of
the brood chamber results in practically all the honey being stored
in the supers and also restricts brood rearing at a time when the
resulting bees develop too late to become gatherers. This is especially
adaptable to locations furnishing an early flow of white honey
followed by a later flow of darker honey. The white or more marketable
honey is stored in the supers and later the brood chamber is
expanded and provisioned for winter with the less desirable honey.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">« 34 »</a></span>
Some beekeepers accomplish a somewhat similar result by hiving
two swarms together in a single hive body.</p>

<p>When practicing contraction it is best to give the full amount of
room at the time of hiving the swarm and to reduce the space three
or four days later, as otherwise the bees are apt to "swarm out"
because of their cramped quarters. Since contraction of the brood
chamber is but a temporary expedient, it should not be continued
beyond the time that its use is of advantage. If there should be a
later honey flow, the brood chamber should be expanded in time to
rear the bees for it. In any event, contraction should not continue
so long as to interfere with securing the proper conditions of the
colonies for winter (<a href="#Page_21">p. 21</a>). Frames of foundation, empty combs,
frames of brood or honey may be used to complete the set of combs
when expanding the brood chamber, and these are usually given
just before or at the close of the honey flow. Contraction of the
brood chamber to less than one hive body, except in hiving swarms,
is not usually advisable.</p>

<p class="center"><a id="Swarm_Control"></a><b>Swarm Control by Manipulation.</b></p>

<p>Swarm control by manipulation enables the beekeeper to operate
a series of apiaries by visiting each at certain intervals, thus eliminating
the necessity of an attendant in each apiary during the swarming
season. The fact that bees usually, by the construction of queen
cells, indicate about a week in advance their intention to swarm,
enables the beekeeper to control swarming by examining each colony
once a week during the swarming period and forestalling the colonies
that are making preparations to swarm. It is also possible to manipulate
all the colonies before any swarming occurs so that most of them
go through the honey flow without swarming, thus eliminating the
weekly examinations.</p>

<p>Any manipulation for swarm control, whether applied after the
colony has acquired the "swarming fever" or applied to all colonies
alike previous to the swarming season, is based upon the single
principle&mdash;<i>a temporary disturbance in the continuity of the daily
emergence of brood</i>. This disturbance should occur just previous to
or during the swarming season. In natural swarming the brood and
the swarm are separated, the swarm being without hatching brood
during a period of three weeks. The brood from which the swarm
came may be allowed to emerge in a separate hive and the resulting
bees may then be returned to the swarm (<a href="#Page_29">p. 29</a>). In this way the
swarming instinct is satisfied, at least temporarily, without materially
decreasing the population of the colony. The beekeeper may anticipate
swarming by removing the brood from the hive, allowing it to
emerge in a separate hive and finally returning these young bees to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">« 35 »</a></span>
the colony in the same manner as is done with the natural swarm.
Under the same conditions the subsequent behavior of a colony
treated in this way is similar to that of a natural swarm. In either
case there has been a break in the continuity of the emergence of
young bees in the hive during a period of three weeks.</p>

<p>Instead of hiving a natural swarm upon empty combs or frames of
foundation, combs of emerging brood (without queen cells) taken from
a colony that has been queenless during a period of 10 to 15 days may
be used (<a href="#Page_33">p. 33</a>) and a similar condition may be had without swarming
by removing all of the brood and substituting such combs of emerging
brood, thus at least temporarily avoiding swarming. In these cases
there is a break of 10 to 15 days in the continuity of the daily
emergence of bees.</p>

<p>A similar interruption of brood rearing may be accomplished by
removing the queen from the hive or caging her within the hive during
a period of 10 days or 2 weeks, then returning her to the combs. In
this case no queen cells must of course be allowed to mature. A condition
similar to this may be obtained without removing the queen by
dividing the brood chamber into two parts with queen-excluding
metal, for a period of 10 to 15 days. The brood from the division
containing the queen is then removed and the bees, together with the
queen, shaken into the other (queenless) division, the queen cells if
any being first destroyed. The brood thus removed may later be
returned to the colony in the form of young bees in the usual manner
(<a href="#Page_29">p. 29</a>). Even the destruction of the sealed brood by uncapping it
has been advised as a means of swarm control. This gives a period of
about 12 days during which few or no young bees emerge.</p>

<p>These methods are illustrative of the principle employed in the
various methods of control by manipulation, which may be classified
under three general headings: (1) Taking the queen from the hive.
(2) Taking the brood from the hive. (3) Separating the queen and
brood within the hive.</p>

<p>The following methods of swarm control are given for the purpose
of illustrating the various types of control by manipulation. It is
not to be understood that all the methods given are equally adaptable
to any locality or season, but it is hoped that, presented in this way,
the beekeeper may more readily see the principle underlying each plan
as well as the basic principle underlying all the plans and thereby be
better enabled to elaborate a system of control to meet his particular
requirements.</p>

<p class="center"><a id="TAKING_THE_QUEEN"></a><b>TAKING THE QUEEN FROM THE HIVE.</b></p>

<p>The temporary removal of the queen from the colony for the
required time (<a href="#Page_36">p. 36</a>) and the return of the same queen is a method
which has been used in swarm control. Of course, no queen cells
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">« 36 »</a></span>
should be permitted to develop in the meantime. Such colonies may
prepare to swarm again, especially if the period of queenlessness is not
more than 10 days. The method is a valuable one, however, and may
be used at any time during the season on colonies making preparations
to swarm.</p>

<p><b>Dequeening in connection with requeening.</b>&mdash;Requeening each colony
with a young queen early in the season may greatly reduce the percentage
of colonies that attempt to swarm but can not be relied upon
as a method of complete control since during a good and prolonged
honey flow quite a number of such colonies prepare to swarm. If
each colony is requeened with a young queen at the beginning of the
honey flow, <i>after having been queenless for 10 or 15 days</i>, there will
probably be very little if any swarming during an ordinary season.
This method is not in general use among beekeepers, largely because
of the difficulty in so timing the operation that there will be no loss.
The following are illustrative of the various adaptations of requeening
in connection with a period of no brood rearing.</p>

<p>(1) Just previous to the honey flow and at about the time that
heavy brood rearing is no longer desirable, remove the queen from each
colony, (<i>a</i>) Eight or ten days later destroy all queen cells but one and
allow the colony to requeen itself, or (<i>b</i>) destroy <i>all</i> queen cells 8 or 10
days after removing the queen, then after 3 to 6 days supply each colony
with a "ripe" queen cell (one in which the queen is ready to emerge),
a virgin queen, or a young laying queen. It is usually desirable that
the interval of queenlessness be as short as possible without defeating
its purpose. Some beekeepers give a young laying queen 10 days
after removing the old one, or a virgin or ripe cell considerably earlier,
sometimes even at the time the old queen is removed, while others
prefer a period of at least 14 days before giving either a laying or a
virgin queen. However, colonies with virgin queens sometimes
swarm even though no other queen cells or larvæ from which to rear
a queen are present. Another objection to the use of queen cells or
virgin queens for this purpose is that some of the queens fail to emerge
and some virgin queens fail to mate, thus leaving the colony hopelessly
queenless. For these reasons, some prefer to have the young queens
mate and begin to lay in "nuclei" (very small colonies) before introducing<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
them in the strong colonies. This method may be used for
the entire apiary at the beginning of the honey flow or it may be
applied only to those colonies making preparations to swarm.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_6" id="Footnote_6"></a><a href="#FNanchor_6"><span class="label">[6]</span></a> The young laying queens may be introduced Into the colony by the ordinary indirect or caging
method (Farmers' Bulletin No. 447, p. 44) or together with a comb of brood and adhering from the
nucleus from which she was mated.</p></div>

<p>(2) Use two hive bodies as a brood chamber before the honey flow,
uniting if necessary to secure strong colonies. At the beginning of
the honey flow divide each colony, leaving the field bees and most of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">« 37 »</a></span>
the brood on the old stand in one hive body, placing the queen,
remaining brood, and enough bees to care for it in the other hive
body which is set beside the first. The supers are of course given to
the queenless colony on the old stand, which after the proper interval
of queenlessness is allowed to requeen itself or is requeened by the
beekeeper as in (1) above. The colony containing the old queen may
be used to strengthen the storing colony by shifting its position from
one side of it to the other (<a href="#Page_31">p. 31</a>), or used for increase.</p>

<p>(3) Ten days before the honey flow is expected to begin, put most
of the brood into a single hive body, on this a queen excluder, and over
this a second hive body with a frame of brood and the queen, the other
combs of this set being empty except perhaps a little brood and honey.
Nine or ten days later remove the upper story, supply it with a bottom
board, and place it close beside the original hive. Destroy queen cells
if any are present in the queenless portion which remains on the old
stand, give a ripe queen cell, virgin queen, or a young laying queen,
and put on the supers. The brood chamber containing the old queen
may be used to make increase or its flying bees may be united with
the storing colony (<a href="#Page_31">p. 31</a>).</p>

<p>By any of these methods there is a break of 10 to 15 days in the
continuity of brood emergence in the brood chamber left on the old
stand and the colonies are requeened with young queens&mdash;each a
strong factor in swarm control and when combined should with rare
exceptions result in no swarming.</p>

<p class="center"><a id="REMOVING_THE_BROOD"></a><b>REMOVING THE BROOD FROM THE HIVE.</b></p>

<p>Since removing the brood brings about conditions quite similar to
that of natural swarming (<a href="#Page_28">p. 28</a>), such a management of the colonies
is practically identical with that of natural swarming. The use of the
brood that is removed (<a href="#Page_29">p. 29</a>), the question of what should be used in
the brood chamber instead of the removed brood (<a href="#Page_32">p. 32</a>), the contraction
of the brood chamber (<a href="#Page_33">p. 33</a>), etc., have been discussed under
natural swarming and need not be repeated here. While some of the
plans using this principle may be applied to all the colonies in the
apiary before swarming actually begins, the usual practice is to apply
them only to such colonies as are making preparations to swarm. It
should not be used on weak colonies, on colonies having a small percentage
of sealed and emerging brood and few young bees, on colonies
in which the queen is failing, or on any colonies during a very poor
season. Under any of these conditions it is usually better to discourage
swarming by destroying queen cells (<a href="#Page_27">p. 27</a>), by removing
one or two frames of brood, or, if some control measure is finally
necessary, by requeening such colonies after an interval of queenlessness.
On the other hand, for strong colonies having a high percentage
of sealed and emerging brood and a good queen the method
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">« 38 »</a></span>
usually gives excellent results, since by its use the workers, queen,
and supers are kept together during the flow. The following are some
of the various plans employing this principle of swarm control:</p>

<p>(1) Find the queen and put the comb on which she is found to
one side, then shake the bees from most of the other combs into or in
front of their hive. As the combs of brood are removed put frames
containing either narrow strips or full sheets of foundation or combs
into the hive and replace the supers. When most of the shaken bees
are in the hive, place the queen among them. Put all the brood and
the few bees remaining thereon into another hive close beside the
shaken colony (<a href="#Fig_17">fig. 17</a>). Enough bees should be left on the combs of
brood to care for it; usually two combs are not shaken at all, but
placed in the other hive with all the adhering bees. For further
disposition of the brood see <a href="#Page_29">page 29</a>.</p>

<p>(2) In order to avoid the trouble of finding the queen, the above
plan may be varied by shaking and brushing <i>all</i> the bees from the
combs so as to be sure that the queen is among them. In this case
the brood may be utilized by one of the following plans: (<i>a</i>) Use
it to build up weaker colonies (<a href="#Page_31">p. 31</a>) or (<i>b</i>) place it in a hive body
over a queen excluder on top of the forced swarm or some colony not
being used for comb-honey production that can spare enough bees
to care for it. In a short time bees will pass through the excluder
and cover the brood, after which the hive body containing it is
removed, supplied with a cover and bottom board, and placed at one
side of the forced swarm so that the emerging bees may later be
added to the swarm. Or (<i>c</i>) after the shaking is complete, remove
the forced swarm and put the hive body containing the brood temporarily
back on the original stand to induce field bees to enter it.
Then in the evening set it aside and restore the swarm to its position
on the old stand. These field bees will be able to prevent the brood
being chilled during the night but in returning from the fields the
next day will enter the hive on the old stand. In the meantime
enough young bees will have emerged to care for the brood.</p>

<p>(3) Removing all the brood and substituting frames containing
narrow strips or full sheets of foundation sometimes results in the
colony swarming out the next day. This may be avoided by removing
the brood in two installments with an interval of a few days
between the two operations. When the brood is not all removed,
full sheets of foundation or empty combs should be used or an
excessive amount of drone comb will be built.</p>

<p>With sectional hives, stand the brood chamber on end, smoke the
bees out of the lower section, and remove it. Destroy queen cells in
the upper hive section. These will almost universally be found projecting
into the space between the two sections of the brood chamber.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">« 39 »</a></span>
Substitute a new hive section containing empty combs or foundation
for the removed section. After, a few days remove the supers,
smoke the bees out of the upper section, remove it, and add it to the
section that was removed before, which at the time of its removal
was given the usual position beside the colony (<a href="#Fig_17">fig. 17</a>).</p>

<p>(4) Use two hive bodies as a brood chamber throughout the year
except during the honey flow. Have both as well filled with brood
as possible previous to the flow. About 10 days before the honey
flow is expected to begin, insert a queen-excluding honey board
(<a href="#Fig_2">fig. 2</a>) between the two hive bodies. The queen is now confined to
a single one of the hive bodies. After 10 days transfer the
queen<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> to the other hive body placed on the old stand and put on
the supers. Remove the hive body in which the queen has been
confined to one side of the colony on the old stand and supply it with
a ripe queen cell (in a protector) or a virgin queen. When the young
queen begins to lay, exchange places with the two hive bodies so
that the one containing the young queen now becomes the storing
colony, giving it the supers and field bees. Shift the hive containing
the old queen from one side to the other of the colony on the old
stand about once a week, so that the entire flying force of both are
at work in the hive with the supers (<a href="#Page_31">p. 31</a>). At the close of the honey
flow the old queen may be killed unless she is especially valuable and
the two divisions may be reunited. The period of 10 days during
which no eggs are laid in the hive body used by the storing colony at
the beginning of the honey flow should delay swarming at least until
the young queen begins to lay. When the other hive body with the
young queen is substituted, it has had a similar period of no egg laying
in addition to having a young laying queen, making a desirable
combination.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_7" id="Footnote_7"></a><a href="#FNanchor_7"><span class="label">[7]</span></a> It is not necessary to find the queen, since the presence of unsealed brood indicates In which hive body
she is confined. She may be transferred to the other hive body by shaking all the bees from the combs
she is known to occupy in with the bees of the other hive body. In this case some bees are returned to
the shaken combs (<a href="#Page_38">p. 38</a>) before this brood is set aside, to prevent its being chilled.</p></div>

<p><b>Mechanical devices.</b>&mdash;A number of mechanical devices have been
described for shifting bees from one brood chamber to another. These
permit the bees to leave the hive when going to the fields and are so
arranged that the returning bees are led to enter the new brood
chamber. This is accomplished by means of switches in the bottom
board or by a chute or tube so attached that the entrance to the
old brood chamber is closed, allowing exit only through the tube
which opens near the entrance of the new brood chamber. In either
case the hives are so arranged that the bees returning from the field
readily enter the new brood chamber. The queen is found and
together with a comb of brood and adhering bees is put into the
new brood chamber, and the supers are transferred from the old to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">« 40 »</a></span>
the new brood chamber. The young bees as they learn to fly are
added to the swarm by the same device. Otherwise the manipulation
is the same as the other methods described.</p>

<p class="center"><a id="SEPARATING_THE_QUEEN"></a><b>SEPARATING THE QUEEN AND BROOD WITHIN THE HIVE.</b></p>

<p>In some swarm-control methods neither the queen nor the brood
is removed from the hive, but these are temporarily separated within
the hive. These methods are ordinarily used only on colonies
making preparations to swarm and are practically equivalent to the
dequeening plan. The following methods make use of this principle
of swarm control:</p>

<p>(1) The queen may be placed in a wire-cloth cage within the hive
or may be confined to a small comb surface within the brood
chamber by means of queen-excluding zinc. No queen cells are permitted
to mature, and the queen is liberated after 10 to 15 days.</p>

<p>(2) The queen together with a comb containing a small amount of
brood is placed in a lower hive body containing no other frames or
combs. After destroying all queen cells the brood is placed in a
second hive body, the two hive bodies being separated by a queen-excluding
honey board and the supers adjusted above the brood
as before. The queen, being separated from the brood by means of
the excluder, lays few eggs in the comb on which she is confined
during this period of separation. After a week or 10 days the queen
cells are again destroyed, and the brood and queen are put back into
a single hive body as before. This method gives results quite similar
to the dequeening method (<a href="#Page_35">p. 35</a>).</p>

<p>If every season were alike in a given locality the beekeeper could
work out a manipulation to be applied to each colony just before or
at the beginning of the honey flow, which would result in practically
no swarming. The wide variation in the seasons, however, renders
it next to impossible to adopt a swarm-control measure that will
prove most profitable every year. The means of control adopted
must be such as to favor the domination of the storing instinct.
Probably the plan of making weekly visits is the most widely used
system of swarm control by manipulation. When a colony is found
preparing to swarm, the brood is removed if conditions are such as
to justify doing so (<a href="#Page_37">p. 37</a>). Otherwise the removal of the queen is
resorted to.</p>

<p>With any of these methods of control the colony may rapidly
restore former conditions, and even though it has been diverted from
swarming may later again prepare to swarm and require a second
manipulation. Generally speaking, when the honey flow is short,
less radical measures are required. Colonies that have been supplied
with young queens after a period of queenlessness have one factor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">« 41 »</a></span>
(the queen) changed with at least some degree of permanency. Colonies
that have been compelled to construct a new set of brood combs
from narrow strips of foundation have the most radical change of conditions
as to brood rearing. Either of these changes alone is usually
sufficient to insure no further preparations to swarm.</p>


<h3><a id="Manipulation_of_the_Supers"></a><b>Manipulation of the Supers.</b></h3>

<p>Proper manipulation of the comb-honey supers is not only a strong
factor in the prevention of swarming but is also a stimulus to storing.
The amount of room the colonies should have in the surplus apartment
varies so much that the ordinary standard super is simply a unit
in a large and flexible surplus apartment. If enough surplus room
is given at the beginning of the season for the storage of the entire
crop of honey, the space so given is too great for best results at the
beginning of the honey flow, and little of it is needed at all if the
season is poor. If, on the other hand, a single super is given and no
other added until the first is completed, the room in the surplus apartment
decreases from the time the super is given until the combs are
completely drawn out, when there is little space left between the
combs, the bees being practically crowded out. Thus while the population
of the colony is increasing their room is being diminished&mdash;a
condition highly conducive to swarming and less energetic work.
After the super is filled, it is some time before the honey is ripened
and sealed, ready to be removed. During this interval, if no other
supers are given, there is no place for storage of the incoming nectar,
and the comb builders must remain idle or waste their wax in building
burr and brace combs. To avoid loss in this way, empty supers
are added as they are needed, and the comb builders move from one
super to another as their work in each is completed. The surplus
apartment, whether consisting of a single super or several supers,
should at all times contain some space for the comb builders.</p>

<p>If the honey flow is heavy and promises to continue, it is desirable
to furnish not only sufficient room but to induce the bees to begin
work in as many sections as possible, giving large comb surface for
the storage and evaporation of the thin nectar, thus in a measure
approximating extracted honey conditions.</p>

<p>There is a danger, however, that if the bees are induced to extend
their work through too many supers, the sections when completed
will be less well filled and therefore lighter in weight. Also, if the
honey flow should not continue as expected a rapid expansion of the
surplus apartment results in a large number of unfinished sections.</p>

<p>The rapidity of the expansion of work in the supers may to some
extent be regulated by the position of each newly added super. If
a rapid expansion is desirable, the empty super is placed below the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">« 42 »</a></span>
supers already on the hive, while if it seems best to crowd the bees
somewhat the empty super is placed above those already on the
hive. When the empty super is placed above the partly finished
ones, the bees do not begin work therein unless they need the room.
This practice is always desirable during a slow honey flow or toward
the close of any honey flow, but when nectar is coming in rapidly
does not result in a rapid expansion of comb building sufficient to
avoid a more or less crowded condition, which in turn causes a loss
of honey and increases the probability of swarming. If each super
is supplied with one or two extracting combs (<a href="#Page_16">p. 16</a>), this disadvantage
of the practice of placing the empty super on top largely disappears,
since the extracting combs are immediately available for the
storage of nectar.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 481px;">
<a name="Fig_19"></a>
<img src="images/fig_19.png" width="481" height="174" alt="" />
<div class="fig_caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 19.</span>&mdash;Arrangement of supers. (Original.)</div>
</div>

<p>When the empty supers are placed under the partly filled ones,
work in them is commenced promptly, but this may be at the expense
of the nearly completed sections, which by this plan are moved
farther from the brood chamber as each empty super is added. In
the case of the super in which the honey is being sealed this distance
is an advantage in so far as the whiteness of the cappings is concerned,
but it may retard the completion of the work. An arrangement
of the supers that to some extent avoids this difficulty is as
follows: Except toward the close of the season, place each newly
added super next to the brood chamber and keep the one nearest
completion just above it with all others arranged above these two,
the one in which least progress has been made being on top (<a href="#Fig_19">fig. 19</a>).
Thus super No. 1 is raised up and No. 2 placed beneath it. When
No. 3 is given, it is placed next to the brood chamber, while above
it is No. 1 with No. 2 on top. If No. 4 is given, it is placed next to
the brood chamber with Nos. 1, 2, and 3 in order above it. By this
arrangement, if conditions justify doing so, strong colonies may be
induced to expand their surplus apartment with great rapidity,
since as soon as the foundation is well drawn in each newly added
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">« 43 »</a></span>
super it may be transposed to the top and an empty one put in its
place. Such rapid expansion of work in the supers should not be
attempted, however, except during a heavy honey flow.</p>

<p>If early in the honey flow the bees are storing rapidly, strong colonies
should be given a second super as soon as work has been fairly
begun in the first. Colonies of medium strength may of course be
allowed to do considerable work in the first super before the second
is given, while a weak colony may have sufficient room for comb
building until the first super is almost completed. The first super
should contain some empty comb when given to the colony, and each
succeeding super should be given in advance of the time when the
bees would be in any way crowded without it. At no time should
all the sections be removed and new supers containing only foundation
be given, but the surplus apartment should contain sections
in all the various stages of development. In this way there is no
break in the work in the supers, and the critical periods, so far as
the super room bears upon the problems of swarming and energetic
work, are largely eliminated.</p>

<p>During the latter part of the honey flow the reasons for further
expansion of the surplus apartment in excess of the immediate
needs of the colonies (<a href="#Page_41">p. 41</a>) no longer exist. At the beginning of a
good honey flow the maximum of new work consistent with well-filled
sections is desirable, while toward the close of the flow the beekeeper
desires the minimum of new work consistent with sufficient
room. The precise period when further expansion of the surplus
apartment is no longer desirable and a concentration of the work
already begun should take place is sometimes difficult to determine,
and to do so requires a thorough knowledge of the locality and good
judgment on the part of the beekeeper.</p>

<p>It is usually desirable to remove the honey as soon after it is
finished as can well be done. If it is left on the hives too long after
it is finished, it is likely to become discolored or "travel stained,"
while if it is taken off too soon some of the sections are not completed.
It is desirable that the honey be removed by entire supers instead
of by individual sections, therefore conditions should be made as
favorable as possible for the completion of all the sections in a super
without the more advanced ones becoming "travel stained." The
bees are more inclined to stain the white surface of the combs toward
the close of the honey flow or during very slow flows. Trouble from
this source is at such time intensified because of the uneven progress
of work in the different sections, the more advanced sections therefore
being sealed some time before the super is sufficiently advanced
to justify its removal. Another form of discoloration is brought
about by the honey being sealed in close proximity to old and dark
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">« 44 »</a></span>
brood combs, in which case some of the darker wax from the old
combs is sometimes apparently used for capping the honey.</p>

<p>During a good honey flow all except the last supers may be left
upon the hives until all or nearly all of the sections of honey are
sealed, since (1) there is little trouble from "travel stain" when
work is progressing rapidly, (2) all the sections in the super are ready
to be sealed at about the same time, and (3) when there are several
supers on each hive the one in which the honey is being sealed is at
least one super removed from the brood combs.</p>

<p>Toward the close of the honey flow all supers having most of their
sections finished should be removed and the sections sorted. The
unfinished sections should be graded according to the degree of completion,
the various grades placed in supers and given to such colonies
as are most likely to finish them. Every effort should be made at
this time to contract the surplus apartment, concentrating the work
upon the sections nearest completion. All supers in which work has
not yet been started should be removed and as soon as possible the
surplus apartment of each colony should be reduced to one super.
Though little room is necessary during the close of the honey flow,
there should always be some room for the storage of new nectar
until it is ripened. For such conditions extracting combs are valuable,
since, instead of giving the last comb-honey super in which little
work would be done, a set of extracting combs may be placed over
the sections to afford room for the incoming nectar and comb surface
for its ripening.</p>

<h3><a id="Removing_the_Honey"></a><b>Removing the Honey from the Hives.</b></h3>

<p>If the honey flow is of considerable duration the major portion of
the crop is removed before the flow ceases. At this time the removal
of the finished supers is comparatively easy because the bees can
readily be driven from them and also because the operator is not
hindered in his work by robbing bees. At the close of the honey
flow all the supers remaining upon the hives should be removed
promptly, since to leave them on would result not only in some of the
honey being carried down into the brood chamber but also in badly
propolized sections. After the honey flow has ceased, great care
should be exercised to keep bees from robbing. The use of bee-escapes
(<a href="#Fig_12">fig. 12</a>) greatly facilitates the removal of the honey at any
time, but their use is especially desirable in removing the honey
remaining on the hives at the close of the honey flow. By their use
the honey may be removed and stored in the honey house with
little disturbance or excitement among the bees. The supers of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">« 45 »</a></span>
honey should of course be taken directly to the honey house or kept
well covered<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> from robbers.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_8" id="Footnote_8"></a><a href="#FNanchor_8"><span class="label">[8]</span></a> Honey from out-apiaries should be loaded for transportation in such a manner that the bees can not
get at it, then before the horse is hitched to the wagon the load of honey should be drawn by hand some
distance from the apiary if the slope of the ground will permit doing so. If this is not possible the horse may
be attached by means of a long rope and the load drawn to a safe distance before the horse is hitched to
the wagon.</p></div>

<p>Before finally storing the supers of honey in the honey room those
that are but partly filled may have their sections removed and
sorted. The unfinished sections that can not be disposed of at a
profit locally are usually put back into supers and the honey they contain
is fed to the bees. This feeding is done by simply exposing the
supers where the flying bees can have access to them. If there are
few supers compared with the number of colonies they should be
placed in piles and only a small entrance allowed, since if free access
were given to a large number of bees they would tear the combs to
pieces. When the bees have finished removing the honey from these
unfinished sections the latter may be stored for future use as "bait"
sections.</p>


<h3><a id="Care_of_Comb_Honey"></a><b>Care of Comb Honey.</b></h3>

<p>In the honey room the supers of honey should be placed in piles
in such a manner as to allow a free circulation of air between them.
This may be done by "sticking them up" as lumber is piled to dry
or by placing alternate supers crosswise. The air in the honey room
should be kept as dry as possible. This is usually accomplished by
means of a high temperature, the honey room being located on the
sunny side of the building or directly under the roof. The windows
should be opened only during dry weather. Ventilation of the honey
room is of no value except when the air that is admitted contains
less moisture than that already present. Otherwise ventilation may
be a positive detriment. If a protracted period of rainy or damp
weather should occur while the honey is in this storage it may be
necessary to use artificial heat to dry the air in the honey room.
Any great variation in temperature should be avoided, since it may
cause a condensation of moisture on the surface of the cappings which
will be absorbed by the honey.</p>

<p>Some beekeepers find it necessary to fumigate comb honey to
prevent damage by the larvæ of the wax moth. For this purpose
sulphur fumes or bisulphid of carbon may be used. If bisulphid of
carbon is used, great care should be taken not to bring it near a flame,
as it is highly inflammable.</p>


<h3><a id="Scraping_Propolis"></a><b>Scraping Propolis from Sections.</b></h3>

<p>Before being packed for market the sections of honey should be
removed from the supers and the wood scraped free of propolis. A
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">« 46 »</a></span>
convenient bench should be provided for this work, with a large
shallow box or tray to catch the propolis as it is scraped from the
sections. This work is usually done by hand, though a few producers
have designed and are using machines for this purpose.</p>


<h3><a id="Grading_Comb_Honey"></a><b>Grading Comb Honey.</b></h3>

<p>The importance of properly grading and packing comb honey does
not seem to be well understood by the average beekeeper. Some
extensive buyers of comb honey find it profitable to regrade and
repack practically all the comb honey they receive before sending it
out to their trade. The producer of this honey of course bears this
extra expense by receiving a lower price for his honey. The lack of
uniformity of grading is to some extent a result of differences of
opinion as to what should be the standard for the various grades.
Grading rules have been of material aid toward greater uniformity,
but various producers may use the same set of grading rules with very
different results. It would be well if a single set of rules were in
use, since honey from various localities may be sent to the same
market. The grading rules in most common use are given in Farmers'
Bulletin 447, page 39.</p>

<p>After scraping the propolis from the wood, each section of honey
may be placed in a pile with others of its grade. Some put the sections
directly into the shipping cases as fast as they are scraped, but
better grading can be done if each grade is put in a separate pile and
the final grading all done by one person. By thus having a large
number of sections in each grade from which to select there is greater
opportunity for making the sections of honey in each case more
nearly uniform as to weight and the various shades of finish. Such
uniformity is especially desirable from the standpoint of the retailer.
Sections containing only a few cells of pollen should be placed in a lower
grade or sold as culls, while those containing a considerable amount
of pollen should not be marketed in the form of comb honey. An
excessive amount of pollen in the sections is usually caused by the
use of very shallow brood combs, extreme contraction of the brood
chamber, or hiving swarms on narrow strips of foundation in the
brood frames with partly drawn comb in the sections (<a href="#Page_32">p. 32</a>).</p>


<h3><a id="Packages_for_Comb_Honey"></a><b>Packages for Comb Honey.</b></h3>

<p>Comb honey is usually packed in cases holding 24 sections (<a href="#Fig_20">fig. 20</a>).
Other sizes are sometimes used to meet special market requirements.
The markets have become accustomed to cases with glass
fronts, by means of which the contents are displayed to advantage.
However, in keeping with present practice in other package goods,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">« 47 »</a></span>
considerable comb honey is now placed on the market having each
section inclosed in a carton. This practice, while losing the advantage
of displaying the honey, has a decided advantage in insuring
security from dust and insects while in the markets as well as greater
safety to the fragile comb
when the package is
finally delivered to the
consumer.</p>

</div>


<h3><a id="Marketing"></a><b>Marketing.</b></h3>

<p>Many beekeepers are
able to dispose of their
entire output of honey in
their local markets, sometimes,
creating quite a demand
for their product by
advertising and demonstrating.
Comb honey that is to be sent to a distant market should
be shipped before cold weather, since the combs become extremely
fragile when cold. Small lots should be crated in "carriers" holding
several cases to prevent breakage by rough handling of individual
cases, while in larger shipments the cases are simply packed in the
car in such a manner that the individual cases can not be thrown
about by the movement of the car.</p>

agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any

  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
